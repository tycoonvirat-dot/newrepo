Predefined Directory
- System Default Directories
- Operating systems often have predefined directories for specific purposes:
- Linux/Unix: /home, /etc, /var, /usr, /tmp

Root user - 

pwd-  present working directory
ls - List of current directory and files
mkdir -  Create Directory
cd- current directory

===================

how to create the files in linux os 

touch - we can create file(multiple file's) but we can't open or edit the file.
cat - We can create a file it will do 2 activity create and automatic open it. and combining file but not able edit the file.
vi - visual editor- it comes default editor for  linux.



step 1: vi filename (devops) ->create the file
step 2: not-editable mode ->user not able to edit
step 3: i in keyboard (we will go to editable mode)
step 4: user can write/edit
step 5: for save the file : user need to come back from editable to non-editable mode 

in keyboard user need to use: esc

w- writeable save/save
q- exit
!- >override

step 6: :wq! - override

How to See Hidden Files
Use: ls -a
- → Shows all files, including hidden ones.
- For detailed view:

ls -la
- → Lists permissions, ownership, size, and includes hidden files.

How to Create a Hidden File
- Just start the filename with a dot:
touch .hiddenfile.txt
mkdir .secretfolder


How to Access Hidden Files
- They behave like normal files. For example:
nano .bashrc
cd .secretfolder

=====================================================================================================================================
Quick Tip
Hidden files are often used for configuration (like .bashrc, .profile, .git). They’re hidden to avoid cluttering your workspace.

how to install a software in linux os
-----------------------------------------
ec2-user
-------
sudo yum install softwarename
sudo yum install softwarename -y
sudo yum install git -y
sudo yum install java-17 -y



how to download a file/software in linux os 
-----------------------------------------
sudo wget url
sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.49/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.49.tar.gz

==============================
ec2-user 
   =>dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/dir5.........dir30
   =>cd ..
=========
cd ~ s  => a shortcut that takes you directly to your home directory.

----------
ec2-user 
   =>dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/dir5.........dir30
=>/
=>cd /
   

how to create a user in linux os and give password the user 
-----------------------------------------------
cd /home
   =>ec2-user 
-------------------------
sudo adduser username
sudo adduser idream
--
sudo passwd username
sudo passwd idream
-----1 time
-----2 time
=================
sudo su - == root user
check how many user have by  -> ls
then ( su - username ) switch to other user 
then if you want go to the another user you have ==> exit  from the existing user and it goes to root.



File Permission in Linux:


When you put Is-I command -it shows a detailed listing of files and directories in the current
directory.

-rW-r -- r -- 1 user group4096 Jan 1510:23 example.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2usergroup4096 Jan 1510:24 directory

-rW-r -- r --: This part indicates the file's permissions. In this example:

The leading dash (-) indicates that it's a regular file.
The leading dash (d) indicates that it's a regular directory.

rw -: The owner (user) has read (r) and write (w) permissions, but no execute (x) permission.
r -: The group (group) has only read (r) permission but no write (w) or execute (x) permission.
r --: Others (everyone else) also have only read (r) permission but no write (w) or execute (x)
permission.

1. 1: The number of hard links to the file. In this case, there's only one link.

2. user: The user who owns the file.

group: The group associated with the file.

4096: The size of the file in bytes. In this case, it's a regular file with a size of 4096 bytes.

5. Jan 15 10:23: The date and time when the file was last modified. In this case, it was modified
on January 15 at 10:23.

example.txt: The name of the file
How to Change File Permission In Linux:
Using chmod we can add, change the file permission.
Let file1: -rw-r -- r --
Example1 sudo chmod u+x file1 : -rwx r- - r- -
Example2 sudo chmod u+x,g+w,o+w,o+x file1 : -rwx r-w rwx

4.

6.

r =read
w = write
x = execute
(- ) = remove the permission
(+)= adding permission
(=) = Assign permission

How to Change File Permission In Octal Mode / Absolute Mode :
Octal Mode :-
. It is working Octal Principal.

.

It will work on 0-7
Principal: -
1= ON
0 = OFF

Based On This Two Principle it will Work: -
0 = no Permission
1 = Execute
2 = Write
3 = Write -Execute
4 = read
5 = Read-execute
6 = read-Write
7 = Read-Write-Execute
Example :-
Sudo chmod 777 filename :- (- rwxrwxrwx )
Sudo chmod 664 filename :- ( - rw- rw- r - -)
UMASK:
Any file and directory that create in our linux system has some default permission.
For fille - rw- rw- r - -
For directory d rwxrwx r -x
For Change the default permission we use umask.
. If you see the current umask value (just put umask command and it is 002)
Maximum permissions can be given to files/directory is 777.
. From the maximum permission we substract the 002 value,
So it will be, 777 - 002 = 775 (so according this value file and directory permission will set)

For directory a 775 (d rwxrwx r - x)
For file a 775 (- rw - rw- r -- )(one important thing you notice here that file not have execute permission on its creation)
. So, in respective of that the equivalent value of default permission of file can't have execute
permission but directory can have the execute permission

Let, 0777-0222 = 0555 (r-xr-xr-x)
So, if I apply umask 0222 it will be (r-xr-x r-x)
For file a r- - r -- r -- (because in file can't have execute permission)
For directory a r - xr- xr - x (directory have execute permission)
umask -s (is used to display the current umask value in symbolic notation.)


Local machine ---> aws linux instance
=======================================
steps 1: Create a new user in the server 
steps 2: Set the password for same 
        sudoers file need open and give permission to newuser
steps 3: Create a .ssh folder/dir in newuser
step  4: Create a file called authorized_keys
step  5: Go to local machine where we are going to access the user 
step  6: Go to cmd and type ssh-keygen -t rsa 
step  7: It will create private and public key in the same machine
step  8: Copy the public key contains and past it authorized_keys
step 9:  Change the permission chmod 400
step 10: Then Enable Password Authentication
                        =>sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
                        =>PasswordAuthentication line and make sure it ends with yes
                        =>ChallengeResponseAuthentication option and disable it by adding no
                        =>sudo systemctl restart sshd
step 11: In local machine 
                open cmd : ssh username@public ip 
				ssh idream@13.203.198.186
				
==========================
chmod 777 devops 
chmod 644 devops 
---------
chmod and umask 
   default => 022
   what is default permission of user 
             =>644 => file
			 =>755 =>dir 
---------------------------------
chown 
   root:root devops 
SUDO CHOWN EC2-USER DEVOPs
sudo chown :ec2-user devops 
sudo chwon ec2-user:ec2-user devops 
----------------
ps -ef => all processes in your system
